KNOWN BUGS LIST [fixes to be implemented sometime later]: 

1. Impossible to use more than one weight for a given font.

	The fix would be: 

		1.1. Change the 'font-load' command interface (add the optional 'weight' parameter); 
		1.2. Change the check in loadFont for font-uniqueness: 

			Currently, it only checks for the family; 
			It also must for the value of 'weight';

2. [Minor inconsistency] The parser's slightly too inacuratte in regard of when there is a NECESSITY in a "/ |\t/"; 

	Fix that (add a "/( |\t)+/")...
	Tailor all the parser's checks accordingly...;

3. svg-values.mjs: arcNextPoint - wrong values [SVG Ellipses again];

	The subtraction-term of 'arcNextPoint' must be one of: 

		1. 1
		2. 10^(-4)

	Depending on the index (i in {0, 1}) and (possibly) other things, like, for instance, rotation angle, radius and so forth...
	Find out exactly, until then - Ellipses are at least (mildly) dysfunctional...;
