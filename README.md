# draw-text

This is a small webpage intended for simple, yet very powerful text-based polygon-drawing. 
It defines a language that allows working with colours, points, lines and filling of images, 
as well as their consequent saving.

All that is required in order to draw something is some little understanding of basic linear 
algebra. Enjoy!
