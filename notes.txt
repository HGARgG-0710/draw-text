1. IDEA: re-do the thing in React? 
	There's a lot of same 'types' (kinds/classes) of elements repeating throughout the HTMl of the page. 
	Starts to bugger oneself a little bit. React-based refactoring could remedy it.
2. Question: hosting? 

	As the thing is serverless, one could use GitHub Pages... 

3. IDEA: create means to program curves ... (?using functions/Infinite series? some recursive name-giving mini-language?); 
4. IDEA: for README, draw something pretty! [in a minimalistic-cubistic-style? how about a Bloodborne hunter picture? Or one of one's characters?]
5. IDEA: add the project's repository GitHub-page area-href-picture; 
6. IDEA: add more details to the page's HTML and CSS; 
	Examples: images for a more 'sophisticated' layout, gradient, multicolours, that kind of thing...;
7. CSS is good (adaptive for SOME screens..., computer screens for instance...), but not good enough for the app to be used on mobile devices...; 
8. ?Add more canvas properties to the project? 
	Ideally, the final thing ought to be something of a total-Canvas-drawing-API-wrapper, 
		but reformulated purely in terms of shapes (that being, 
			the entire programming paraphanalia is taken out - only these elementary instructions remain).
